The update comes with two additions to upload data into MongoDB: SingleUpload.js & BulkUpload.js

SingleUpload.js:--
   Uploads a single json file (located inside the /data directory) to MongoDB Cloud DB.
   How to run the code:
	1) open cmd and change directory to the location where 'singleupload.js' is located
	2) run command 'node singleupload.js'
	3) You'll be prompted to input the filename. Input the name of the file you want to upload. Eg "AllZilaData.json". Press enter.
	   Note: The file must be present inside the /data directory.
	4) Now, you'll be promted to enter the name of the collection you want to insert the data into.
	   So, for the 'AllZilaData.json' we want to insert the data into the collection 'AllZilaData'. Then press enter.
	   Note: Make sure the collection name exists in the mongoDB cloud. Otherwise, a new collection will be made with the name you entered.
	
	The data will now be uploaded and you'll see the progress and the data is being uploaded.
	On successful completion you'll be shown the message "TASK COMPLETE".


BulkUpload.js
    Uploads all files in /data directory to mongoDB cloud.
    How to run the code:
	1) open cmd and change directory to the location where 'bulkupload.js' is located
	2) run command 'node bulkupload.js'
	3) You'll be asked to confirm whether or not you're sure to upload and overwite all the data. Enter "Y" and press enter.
	
	The data will now be uploaded and you'll see the progress and the data is being uploaded.
	On successful completion you'll be shown the message "TASK COMPLETE".
   
    Note: The file names along with their respective collection name are predefined in the code.
    Please see the code in the bulkupload.json to see the file names and their corresponding collections.
